Goal : To create a robust prediction and classification system to predict earthquakes,cyclones and storms.

Technologies used: OpenWeatherMap API, Flutter, Scripts coded in Python, Matlab or Octave, Support Vector Machine & One vs Rest ML Models, C#, Azure SDK.

Workflow:
The ML Scripts are stored on the cloud and process the real-time data from the OpenWeatherMap API at regular intervals. In case the probability of a disaster is above average, (Say 0.6 is the average) then an SMS alert is sent to the evacuation authorities and media bodies in that locality by using Twilio and Azure Services. People having the mobile app will be alterted by a notification with evacuation procedures & protective measures.

Abstract:
Cyclones and storms are complicated in their pattern of movement and pretty complex to analyse. Predicting them has been a problem which has been given some attention but still needs to be made into a more robust system. Similarly, predicting and managing earthquakes is indeed a difficult task , since the seismic readings play a vital role in the same.We would be creating a model to accurately classify these disasters based on real time data .
The development of the model will take advantage of LSTM's and various regression methods to build a plausible model.
Feature engineering will also be used to analyse images for high quality results.
